# Overview of Computer Architecture

To become effective at programming, you have to know how computers are built. Computer architecture refers to the design of a computer’s components that execute programs.

## Key Components

1. **Input**:
      - **Definition**: Data or instructions provided to the computer by users or devices (e.g., keyboard, sensors).
      - **Role in Programming**: Programs often begin by receiving input, such as numbers or text, to process.
      - **Example**: An application would accept a user's name from a keyboard as input to personalized messaging.

2. **Output**:
      - **Definition**: Results or information the computer produces after processing input.
      - **Role in Programming**: Programs generate output, such as writing into a display unit or writing into a file.
      - **Example**: An application that adds 5 and 7 shows "12" to the screen.

3. **RAM (Random Access Memory)**:
      - **Definition**: Temporary storage for data and instructions while a program runs.
      - **Role in Programming**: Stores variables (like a score or user input) for faster retrieval during program run time.
      - **Key Point**: RAM is volatile—the data is erased when you turn off your computer.
      - **Example**: A program that follows a score in a game stores the value in RAM for real-time updating.

4. **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**:
      - **Definition**: Permanent storage for essential instructions, like firmware or boot-up processes.
      - **Role in Programming**: Rarely accessed directly by programmers. ROM is what instructs the computer to boot and load the operating system.
      - **Key Point**: ROM is non-volatile, retaining data without power.

5. **Binary and Digital Signals**:
      - **Definition**: Computers use binary (0s and 1s) to represent data and instructions, based on digital signals (on/off states in circuits).
      - **Role in Programming**: Programm is initially converted into binary (machine code) before executing in the processor.
      - **Why Binary?**: Hardware uses electrical signals with two states, represented as 0 and 1.
      - **Example**: The character "B" is stored as a binary code (e.g., 01000010 in ASCII) for processing.

## Programming and Architecture

- Programs receive input from devices like keyboards or mice.
- They store and manipulate data in RAM during execution.
- The processor executes instructions, stored as binary in RAM or ROM.
- Programs generate output, for example, characters on a screen or files on a storage.
