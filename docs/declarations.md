# Declarations

## Introduction

In C programming, declarations are fundamental as they inform the compiler about the identifiers (like variables or functions) used in the program. They specify the type and sometimes the initial value of these identifiers, helping the compiler manage them correctly.

## What is a Declaration?

A declaration is a statement that introduces an identifier and its data type to the program. It tells the compiler:

- The **name** of the identifier (e.g., a variable or function).
- The **type** of data it holds (e.g., integer, float, character).
- Optionally, an **initial value**.

Declarations ensure the compiler knows how to handle the identifier before it is used.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a basic example of a variable declaration:

```c
int age = 25; // Declares a variable 'age' of type integer with value 25
```

In this example, `int` is the data type, `age` is the variable name, and `25` is the initial value.

## Types of Declarations

There are many types of declarations in C, such as variables, functions, arrays, pointers, and structures. We will explore these in detail throughout the course.
