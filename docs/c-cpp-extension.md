# Installing the C/C++ Extension for Visual Studio Code

The "C/C++" extension by Microsoft is the go-to tool for C and C++ programming in VSCode. It adds features like IntelliSense (code completion), debugging, and code browsing to make coding easier.

## Installation Steps

1. **Open VSCode**:
      - Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.

2. **Access the Extensions View**:
      - Click the Extensions icon in the left sidebar (it looks like a square with two arrows).
      - Or use the shortcut:
         - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + X`
         - macOS: `Cmd + Shift + X`

3. **Search for the Extension**:
      - In the Extensions view, type `C++` in the search bar at the top.

4. **Install the Extension**:
      - Find the "C/C++" extension by Microsoft (make sure itâ€™s published by Microsoft).
      - Click the "Install" button.
      - Installation takes a few seconds, and a checkmark will appear in the Extensions view when done.

5. **Verify Installation**:
      - Create a new file with a `.c` extension (e.g., `test.c`).
      - Type `prin` and check if IntelliSense suggests `printf`. This confirms the extension is working.
