# Statements

## What is a Statement in C?

A **statement** in C programming is a single instruction or command that the computer executes. Itâ€™s like a sentence in a language that tells the program to perform a specific action. Statements are the building blocks of a C program, and they are executed one after another in the order they appear in the code.

In simpler terms, a statement is a line of code that does something, like printing output. Each statement typically ends with a **semicolon (`;`)**, which acts like a period in a sentence, telling the compiler that the statement is complete.

## Key Characteristics of Statements

- **Executable**: A statement tells the computer to perform an action.
- **Semicolon-terminated**: Most statements in C end with a `;`.
- **Single Purpose**: Each statement usually performs one specific task.
- **Part of a Program**: Statements combine to form the logic of a program.

## Example

```c
printf("Hello, World!\n");
```

This statement tells the computer to print the text "Hello, World!" on the screen.

## Why Are Statements Important?

- **Control Program Flow**: Statements define what the program does and in what order.
- **Simplicity**: Each statement focuses on one task, making code easier to read and understand.
- **Flexibility**: By combining statements, you can create programs to solve various problems.
