# What is Programming?

## Definition

Programming is the process of providing instructions to a computer for it to execute given tasks. The instructions, coded in a programming language, inform the computer on how to process data, implement solutions to problems, or manage hardware.

## Why Program?

Programming allows us to:

- **Automate Tasks**: Computers carry out repetitive tasks quickly and precisely, like sorting lists or processing transactions.
- **Solve Problems**: Break down complex challenges into logical steps, such as calculating budgets or analyzing data.
- **Build Software**: Develop anything ranging from operating systems to mobile applications.
- **Drive Innovation**: Enable advancements in fields like artificial intelligence, gaming, and scientific research.

## Why Learn Programming?

- **Problem-Solving**: Develops logical thinking and structured approaches to challenges.
- **Career Growth**: Programming skills are in high demand across industries like tech, finance, and healthcare.
- **Creativity**: Design custom tools or programs to suit particular needs.
- **Tech Literacy**: Understand how computers and software operate in a world that is technology-based.

**Example**: Suppose you have to calculate the total cost of items in a shopping cart. A program can add the costs automatically, which is faster and less error-prone than calculating manually.
