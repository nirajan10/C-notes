# Introduction to Control Structures

Up to now, we have written programs that execute in a linear order, following a straight sequence of instructions from top to bottom. The topics covered so far include:

- Basic syntax
- Input and output
- Variables
- Data types
- Operators

In linear execution, each statement runs once in sequence, without decisions or repetitions. However, real-world applications often require programs to make choices based on conditions (e.g., user input or calculations) or repeat tasks multiple times (e.g., processing lists or performing calculations). **Control structures** enable this flexibility by allowing decision-making and repetition, transforming simple scripts into dynamic and powerful programs.

## Why Control Structures Are Necessary

Control structures are essential because they:

- **Enable decision-making**: Programs can choose different paths based on conditions, making them interactive and adaptable.
- **Support repetition**: Loops allow code to run multiple times without duplication, saving effort and improving efficiency.
- **Handle complex logic**: They facilitate error checking, data processing, and optimization, which are critical for practical software.

Without control structures, programs would be limited to rigid, linear sequences, incapable of handling variability or iterative tasks.

Control structures in C are divided into two categories:

1. **Conditional Statements**: For decision-making.

2. **Loops**: For repetition.
